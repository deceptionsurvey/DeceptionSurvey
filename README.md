# DeceptionSurvey

## ðŸ‘‹ This repository is not the main focus. Please refer to our [website](https://deceptionsurvey.com/) for more information!

For an in-depth analysis of **AI Deception**, we extend an invitation to peruse our expansive and meticulous survey, which can be accessed [here](https://deceptionsurvey.com/). Preprint version will be released soon. 

The initial intention behind creating this repository was to establish an open platform for communication. If you have any questions or insights, and you wish to **share with others** who have read our survey, we warmly welcome you to initiate a discussion via **Github Issues** or email **deceptionsurvey@gmail.com**.

Please visit **www.deceptionsurvey.com** for further exploration.
